This repository contains copies of current and past fsxNet nodelists.

The current compressed and uncompressed nodelist can be found in the root directory. 

FSXNET.?nn files are compressed using Zip with ?? equal to the last two digits of day-of-year.

FSXNET.nnn files are uncompressed and use a convention where nnn is a three digit number representing 
the day-of-year of the Friday publication date, with zeros filling positions to the left if necessary.
